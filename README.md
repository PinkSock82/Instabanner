The Instagram Profile Banner Thingy Chrome Extension

Do not even try to install it, It worked when I tested it, but now it does not. I screwed up somewhere. Anyways it's mostly filler.
I had to delete icon.png due to copyright infringement issues, you can add any picture and put it back if you want. It does not work anyways as stated before.
No copyright infrigement intended.
